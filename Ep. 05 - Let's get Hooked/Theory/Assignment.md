## Q: What is the difference between `Named export`, `Default export`, and `* as export`?
A: ES6 provides us to import & export a module and use it in other files. ES6 provides two ways to export a module from a file: `named export` and `default export`.
In `Named export`, one can have multiple named exports per file. Then import the specific exports they want surrounded in `{}` braces. The name of imported module has to be the same as the name of the exported module.
In `Named export`, the component is exported from MyComponent.js file like:
```
export const MyComponent = () => {}
export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
``` 
and the component is imported from MyComponent.js file like: here we must use `{}` in MyComponent.
```
// ex. importing a single named export
import { MyComponent } from "./MyComponent";

// ex. importing multiple named exports
import { MyComponent, MyComponent2 } from "./MyComponent";

// ex. giving a named import a different name by using "as":
import { MyComponent2 as MyNewComponent } from "./MyComponent";
```

In `Default export`, One can have only one default export per file. The naming of import is completely independent in default export and we can use any name we like.
In `Default export`, the component is exported from MyComponent.js file like:
```
const MyComponent = () => {}
export default MyComponent;
```
and the component is imported from MyComponent.js file like: here we must omit `{}` in MyComponent.
```
import MyComponent from "./MyComponent";
```

In `* as export`, it is used to import the whole module as a component and access the components inside the module.
In `* as export`, the component is exported from MyComponent.js file like:
```
export const MyComponent = () => {}
export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
export const MyComponent3 = () => {}
``` 
and the component is imported from MyComponent.js file like:
```
import * as MainComponents from "./MyComponent";
```
Now we can use them in JSX as:
```
<MainComponents.MyComponent />
<MainComponents.MyComponent2 />
<MainComponents.MyComponent3 />
```
We can use `Named export` and `Default export` together. So you should export like:
```
export const MyComponent2 = () => {}
const MyComponent = () => {}
export default MyComponent;
```
and import like:
```
import MyComponent, {MyComponent2} from "./MyComponent";
```
## Q: What is the importance of `config.js` file?
# Importance of `config.js` File

The `config.js` file plays a crucial role in many software projects, particularly in web development, by centralizing configuration settings that are needed across different parts of the application. Here's why it's important:

## 1. Centralized Configuration
- `config.js` provides a single location for configuration settings, making it easier to manage and update settings like API endpoints, database connections, environment variables, and feature flags without modifying multiple files.

## 2. Environment-Specific Settings
- It often holds environment-specific configurations (e.g., development, testing, production) that can be dynamically loaded based on the environment in which the application is running. This helps in deploying the same codebase across different environments with different settings.

## 3. Security and Best Practices
- Sensitive data such as API keys, secrets, and database credentials should be stored in configuration files (ideally separate from the source code and managed securely). Using `config.js` helps separate this data from the business logic.

## 4. Simplifies Maintenance
- By keeping configuration data in one place, it simplifies the maintenance and reduces the risk of errors when updating or deploying new settings. This approach also improves code readability and maintainability.

## 5. Flexibility and Scalability
- `config.js` can make the application more flexible and scalable by allowing different configurations to be easily swapped or extended as the application grows or evolves.

## 6. Version Control
- Configuration files like `config.js` can be tracked in version control systems, making it easier to see what configuration changes were made over time, which is useful for debugging and audits.

In summary, `config.js` is essential for managing the configuration of an application in a structured, secure, and maintainable way.

## Q: What are `React Hooks`?
A: In React version 16.8, React introduced a new pattern called Hooks. React Hooks are simple JavaScript functions that we can use to isolate the reusable part from a functional component. Hooks can be stateful and can manage side-effects.
Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.
### React provides a bunch of standard in-built hooks:
- useState: To manage states. Returns a stateful value and an updater function to update it.
- useEffect: To manage side-effects like API calls, subscriptions, timers, mutations, and more.
- useContext: To return the current value for a context.
- useReducer: A useState alternative to help with complex state management.
- useCallback: It returns a memorized version of a callback to help a child component not re-render unnecessarily.
- useMemo: It returns a memoized value that helps in performance optimizations.
- useRef: It returns a ref object with a current property. The ref object is mutable. It is mainly used to access a child component imperatively.
- useLayoutEffect: It fires at the end of all DOM mutations. It's best to use useEffect as much as possible over this one as the useLayoutEffect fires synchronously.
- useDebugValue: Helps to display a label in React DevTools for custom hooks.


## Q: Why do we need `useState Hook`?
A: `useState hook` is used to maintain the state in our React application. It keeps track of the state changes so basically useState has the ability to encapsulate local state in a functional component.
The  useState hook is a special function that takes the `initial state` as an `argument` and `returns an array` of two entries.  UseState encapsulate only singular value from the state, for multiple state need to have useState calls.
#### Syntax for useState hook
```
const [state, setState] = useState(initialstate);
```
#### Importing: To use useState you need to import useState from react as shown below:
```
import React, { useState } from "react";
```
we can use Hooks in Functional Components
```
const Example = (props) => {
  // You can use Hooks here!
  return <div />;
}
```
